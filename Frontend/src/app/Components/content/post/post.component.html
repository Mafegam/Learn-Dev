                Intro to HTML</h1>
        </header>
        <p class="lead">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages.
            It consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make
            it appear or act a certain way.</p>
        <p>Every HTML document follows a basic structure:</p>

        <pre class="snippet "><code class="language-html text-white backdrop-saturate-125">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;!-- Content goes here --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Replace <kbd>&lt;!-- Content goes here--&gt;</kbd> with your actual content, such as headings, paragraphs,
            images, links, lists, forms, etc., depending on what you want to display on your webpage. <br><br>Here’s a
            simple
            example with some content:</p>

        <pre class="snippet"><code class="language-html text-white">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my website&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph introducing my website&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description"&gt;
        &lt;a href="about.html">Learn more about us&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <!-- &lt;&gt;
        <kbd>&lt;&gt;</kbd> -->

        <ul>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</kbd> Declares the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;html&gt;</kbd> Root element that wraps all content on the page.
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> Container for meta-information about the document, such as title, links to CSS
                stylesheets, and scripts.
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd> Sets the title of the webpage (displayed in the browser tab).
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> Contains all the content that will be displayed in the browser window.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <p> In this example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd> is used for the main heading.
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd> is used for a paragraph of text.
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd> displays an image.
            </li>
            <li> <kbd>&lt;a&gt;</kbd> creates a hyperlink. You can expand and customize the content within the
            </li>


        </ul>


        <!-- <div>
            <p>You can expand and customize the content within the <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> tag to suit your needs, and
                the
                comment
                <kbd> &lt;!-- Content goes here --&gt;</kbd> serves as a reminder or instruction for where to place that
                content.
            </p>

            <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
            <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                will come in handy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                    follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                    usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                </li>
                <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                    properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                    providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                    design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
            <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
            <p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p>
            <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
            <h4>Type properties</h4>
            <p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across
                letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.</p>
            <h4>Baseline</h4>

            <h4>Measurement from the baseline</h4>

            <h3>Type classification</h3>
            <h4>Serif</h4>
            <p>A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter.
                Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the
                following:</p>
            <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
                <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
                <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
            </ul><img src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png" alt="">

            <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
            <p><strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to
                the real deal. If you’re simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
                prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than
                enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with
                on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.</p>
            <p><strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user
                would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,
                considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right
                path.</p>
            <p><strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more
                user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what will
                be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order
                of priority. This way, you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at the heart
                of your design.</p>
            <p>And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.
